<h2> "Ugly" -another complaint states</h2>
<h2>"Does anybody like the new Rebrand of twitter to X ?"" -Sambucha(youtuber)</h2>
<h2>From Twitter to X: Elon Musk Begins Erasing an Iconic Internet Brand</h2>
<p>As of now, X is essentially the same app as Twitter, just with a new name and logo. This means the iconic blue bird mascot of Twitter has gone the way of the dodo, and is no more. </p>
<br>
<p>However, reports suggest that new owner Elon Musk has grand plans for X, and could potentially make the app unrecognisable compared to its Twitter days. So what is this new X app and how will it differ to Twitter? Here’s everything we know so far. </p>
<br>
<h2>What is X ?</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, X is just a different guise for the social media app Twitter. Besides from the new logo, X looks exactly the same as Twitter, with a vertical timeline featuring posts from other users. It’s one the biggest social platforms for news outlets, politicians, celebrities and more. </p>
<br>
<p>It seems that Musk wants to emulate WeChat, which is a successful super-app in China that offers multiple functions beyond social media, including text messaging, voice messaging, video conferencing, gaming, location sharing, photo and video sharing and mobile payments. </p>
<br>
<p>This valid and supposedly good step to the future however has not stopped X from getting a hefty ton a negativity, such as people leaving comments like:</p>
<p>1. What do we call twitter now ? as the iconic blue bird , Larry, on a white background , which has stayed the main Brading for over 16 years, suddenly changed with seemingly no good reason for it.</p>
<p>2.“Bring back the BIRD,” “GIVE US BACK THE BIRD!!!”.</p>
<br>
<p>According to data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, nearly 78% of all the U.S. iOS reviews of the newly renamed X app have been 1-star reviews since July 24th</p>
<br>
<p>The case is also not helped by the history of twitter since Mr.Musk bought the company,Firing countless employees like the CEO himself and trying to monetize the app needing subscriptions to get the iconic blue tick for verifications , leading to countless fake accounts.</p>
<br>
<p>However, the rebranding has not been all bad news for the company formerly known as Twitter.

    In fact, Sensor Tower’s data indicates that X’s worldwide installs grew 20% week-over-week in the wake of the rebranding. There was a related 3-4% increase in weekly user growth, as well.</p>
